# ServerKit Roadmap

> **Status: core phases complete — actively developed.** All original core phases below have shipped. Development now focuses on three tracks: the **deployment experience** (a live deploy console with streaming logs), the **extension platform** (runtime loading, signed releases, standalone extension repos), and **new capability areas delivered as installable extensions** through the built-in Marketplace — plus stability fixes and UI/UX polish from community reports. See **Active Development** below for what's in flight; the phase list is kept as the historical record of how the core was built out.

This document outlines the development roadmap for ServerKit. Features are organized by phases and priority.

---

## Current Version: v1.7.x (In Development)

### Recently Completed (v1.7.x)

- **See Where an App Is Slow** - Every site nginx serves now logs how long each request took, what the upstream took and whether the cache answered, and the panel rolls that up per app: requests, 4xx/5xx, p50/p95/p99 latency and cache hit ratio on the app's Overview, kept for two days by the minute and a month by the hour. A rule-based check reads those numbers together with the app's and its database's CPU and names the likely bottleneck (a busy app over an idle database, one query dominating a busy database, errors during deploys, a cache that misses), with the fix and that fix's failure mode, and never adds anything on its own. Apps whose containers keep crashing and restarting are flagged with an incident instead of looking "running" between crashes, and each database container gets an Insights tab with its top queries, connections in use and buffer-cache hit ratio.
- **Faster Sites Without New Moving Parts** - Responses are compressed (gzip, and brotli where the nginx build has it) for every site; the snippet only adds what your nginx.conf doesn't already set, because a repeated directive stops nginx from loading. The page cache became a real one: each site sets its own lifetime, visitors get the last good page while the app errors or refreshes, a stampede of misses reaches the app as one request, and clearing it clears that site only. Proxied sites can long-cache fingerprinted assets such as `app.3f9a2c1d.js`, and the Cloudflare extension adds Cache Rules presets and an opt-in purge of an app's hostnames after every deploy.
- **Attach a Cache, a Bucket, a Queue or Tracing** - Installing Redis and having an app use Redis used to be two unrelated things. From an app's Overview you now attach a cache, object storage, a queue or tracing: ServerKit reuses an installed service or installs one, writes the connection settings the app's libraries expect (`REDIS_URL`, the `S3_*` and `AWS_*` set, `AMQP_URL`, the standard OpenTelemetry variables), and puts both on a private service network. Storage gives each app its own bucket with a key that can only reach it; the secret stays in the vault. Object storage is now Garage, because MinIO stopped publishing images, and RabbitMQ and an OpenTelemetry Collector join the catalog. Grafana gets Prometheus and Loki as data sources, plus a dashboard of your servers, by attaching them, and an installed Prometheus scrapes the panel with a token the panel issues itself. PostgreSQL can run PgBouncer beside it for apps that opt into the pooled URL, and build-pack apps run their Procfile `worker:` and `scheduler:` lines next to the web process.

- **Managed Databases Join the Recycle Bin** - Deleting a managed database no longer destroys it on the spot. Like applications before it, a deleted database now lands in the Recycle Bin with its content and backup policy intact and restorable; only an explicit purge (or asking for the data to be dropped at delete time) is destructive. The distinction that matters: delete keeps your data, purge is the irreversible step, and the UI says which one you are about to do.
- **One Error Shape, With a Request ID You Can Quote** - Every API error now comes back in one consistent JSON envelope carrying a request correlation id, so "it failed" in a bug report can be matched to the exact request in the panel's error monitor. Behind that, crashes a route used to catch and quietly convert into a vague 200 or a bare 500 — the PR-webhook receiver, the job queue bus, and several others — are now recorded in the error monitor every time, with tests pinning that a swallowed crash is a bug, not a behavior.
- **Live Streams and Polling That Behave** - Panel pages pause their background polling when the tab is hidden and catch up the moment you return, so an idle dashboard tab stops costing server load and laptop battery. Live output (deploys today, more run kinds on the same rails next) streams through one event scheme with a shared room grammar, and the deploy console keeps working unchanged through the transition.
- **Remote-Access Tunnels Reconcile on Every Transport** - Tunnel reconciliation used to fire only for agents connected over WebSocket; an agent on the HTTP long-poll fallback missed it. Both transports now go through the same door, so a NAT'd box behind a strict proxy gets the same tunnel repair behavior as everyone else.
- **Credential Encryption Failures Are No Longer Silent** - A failure to encrypt stored server credentials used to keep the old value without telling anyone. It now surfaces as an error, so a misconfigured encryption key is something you find out about at save time, not at the next incident.
- **Run It Behind Your Own Reverse Proxy** - Already running Caddy, Traefik or Nginx Proxy Manager, with Let's Encrypt or a private CA of your own? That is now a supported, documented and tested way to run the panel rather than something you reverse-engineer from the install script. Two topologies are written up — keep ServerKit's nginx (full features, host install) or point your proxy straight at the panel (panel only, the Docker shape) — with proxy config snippets, the two environment variables that matter, and a symptom-to-cause table for the redirect loop, the rejected websocket and the wrong client IPs. A new installer switch sets a box up this way in one line, and an install-config file makes the whole thing re-runnable. Tests now pin the properties an external proxy depends on: the panel emits no redirect to HTTPS from any of its 352 routes, the public URL is honoured as a websocket origin while strangers are rejected, and HSTS stays off when TLS is somebody else's job.
- **Rate Limits and Audit Logs See the Real Visitor** - The panel is always served through its own nginx, so every request arrived carrying nginx's address rather than the visitor's — and the installer never turned on the setting that recovers the real one. Per-IP rate limiting, the login brute-force block and every audit-log entry were therefore keyed on a single local address, which quietly weakened all three: one abusive client shared a bucket with everyone else. New installs now enable it, and re-running the installer backfills it on existing ones without touching a value you set yourself. It deliberately stays off when the backend port is exposed directly, because a visitor who can reach it without passing through nginx can simply claim any address they like.
- **Installing With a Domain No Longer Breaks nginx** - Setting a panel domain at install time wrote a bare-IP redirect that declared itself a second default server on port 80 — something nginx refuses outright, in both HTTP and HTTPS modes, so nginx would not start and the installer had no `nginx -t` to say why. The redirect now matches a bare IP by name pattern instead of competing for the default, verified against real nginx, with a regression guard.
- **Docker Actually Runs the Panel** - `docker compose up -d` started nothing at all: every service had ended up behind an opt-in profile while the README and install guide still gave that command as the way to install with Docker. It now runs the real all-in-one panel on port 5000 with a persistent volume for the database. The image itself could not boot either — it wrote its database to a directory it never created — and the developer docs pointed at a compose file that has never existed. All corrected, with a guard so a profile change cannot silently empty the default command again.
- **Uptime Monitors** - Monitoring is no longer only about the machine the panel runs on. A monitor watches anything you point it at — a website, an API endpoint, a database port, a mail server or a managed WordPress site — with HTTP, keyword, port, ping, DNS and SMTP checks, per-monitor intervals, expected status ranges, redirect and TLS-verification switches, and a retry threshold before anything is declared down. A scheduler polls them continuously (previously checks only ran when someone pressed a button), outages open and close an incident on their own, and each monitor gets a detail page with a response-time chart, a 90-day uptime strip, a live check log and TLS certificate expiry. Host CPU/memory/disk alerting is unchanged and now shares one Incidents timeline with monitor outages, so "something is wrong" is a single place. Status pages publish monitors you already have rather than defining their own duplicate probes.
- **Monitoring Navigation** - Monitors, Incidents, Events and Jobs are tabs of one Monitoring group instead of scattered top-level pages, and the events stream was rebuilt on the same search-and-filter layout as the rest of the panel.
- **Themes & Theme Studio** - A gallery of color themes in Settings → Appearance (Paper, Nord Deep, Gruvbox, Phosphor, High Contrast, and the stock look), applied instantly and previewed live, kept as each user's personal choice on top of the dark/light toggle. Themes are data, not code — a small map of color tokens — so a built-in Theme Studio lets anyone edit colors over the live panel and export a shareable file, admins can set a panel-wide default or import a theme, and a public community registry installs themes with one click.
- **Deploy Console & Live Run Logs** - Every install and deploy lands on one full-page live console: streaming build output, a step timeline with per-step durations and a live elapsed timer, and failure cards showing the real error tail with plain-language hints and one-click retry. Backed by a unified batched run-log layer (database persistence + WebSocket push with a polling fallback).
- **New Service Wizard & Template Catalog** - Three-step service creation (Source / Connect / Review) backed by a server-side template catalog with one-click compose templates and Git-repo templates.
- **Extensions Platform Maturation** - Marketplace registry backed by standalone extension repos (Kubernetes, Automations, Analytics, Mail, GPU, CrowdSec, DNS server, and more), with built-in features progressively extracted to keep the default panel lean. Installed extensions that ship a prebuilt bundle now render their UI on a production panel with no rebuild.
- **Privacy-First Web Analytics** - Cookieless, self-hosted analytics extension with WordPress and nginx integration and optional geo lookup.
- **Agent Fleet & Peering** - ServerKit-to-ServerKit peering (embedded agent mode), fleet doctor tooling, and agent capability upgrades.
- **Honest Extension Trust** - Installed extensions get a Permissions view showing what their manifest declared against what the panel has actually observed them do — including calls it refused. It is deliberately candid about its own limits: for capabilities the panel cannot mediate it says so outright rather than showing a reassuring zero, because an extension runs inside the panel process and no permission string changes that. The Python packages an extension shipped that the panel declined to install (they are opt-in, since pip runs with the backend's privileges) are now listed with the file itself and the exact setting to change, instead of being mentioned only in an install log nobody reads.
- **A Failed Deploy No Longer Takes the Site Down** - Redeploys used to stop the running version first and only then discover that the new one could not start: a broken compose file, an image that no longer pulls, or a port something else had taken left the site down until someone intervened. Every deploy path now proves the new version can run *before* anything live is stopped — the compose file is validated, images are built and pulled to completion, and host port conflicts are checked — and a failure aborts with the running deployment untouched and a log line saying so. On single-container apps the registry pull in particular used to happen *after* the old container was already removed, so a registry hiccup left the app with nothing running at all.
- **Fleet Health & Working Repair Buttons** - The health doctor now sweeps connected servers as well as the panel's own host, with per-server findings that offer the same one-click repairs, an offline server reported as offline rather than missing, and a daily fleet-wide sweep. The backup checks' repair buttons now actually work: a restore drill can be started from the doctor and tracked as a job, and an unverified backup can be verified in place or against its offsite copy, whichever it has.
- **Secure by Default on a Fresh Install** - A stock Debian/Ubuntu install now ends with a firewall instead of a warning: UFW is installed and enabled with default-deny inbound, allowing only the ports sshd actually answers on plus 80/443 and the panel's own port. The SSH port is discovered from the effective sshd config rather than assumed to be 22, and if it cannot be determined the installer refuses to enable anything rather than risk locking you out. fail2ban with an SSH jail moved from the "full" profile into the standard one, watching the same port. Setup Health gained firewall and brute-force-protection checks, surfaced on the dashboard, so a box that skipped either says so instead of looking fine.
- **Auth & Proxy Hardening** - Trusted reverse-proxy client-IP handling and per-IP login brute-force throttling.
- **Certificate & DNS Reliability** - Certificates stop failing for reasons the panel could see and didn't say. certbot is found wherever it is installed, including the snap location its own docs recommend, and requesting a certificate checks the nginx plugin first and names the missing package instead of passing certbot's internal confusion through. A stray AAAA record — the classic case where the IPv4 record is perfect and issuance still fails, because Let's Encrypt prefers IPv6 — is now detected and explained by both domain verification and the doctor. One Let's Encrypt contact address is remembered panel-wide rather than re-typed for every certificate, and the doctor catches an nginx that is running but serving a config it can no longer parse.
- **UI Polish** - Skeleton loading states, unified tab groups and segmented bars, drawer-based flows, modal-based env var management.

- [x] Server template builder — define expected state (packages, services, firewall rules, users, files)
- [x] Template library — save and reuse templates (e.g., "Web Server", "Database Server", "Mail Server")
- [x] Apply template to server — install packages, configure services, set firewall rules via agent

# Active Development (H2 2026)

Current focus areas on the `dev` branch. Core work centers on the deploy experience and
platform infrastructure; new capability areas ship as Marketplace extensions.

## AI Assistant: Prompture Provider Connections (implemented)

Community request: D3M4L, September 1, 2026 — connect the assistant to OmniRoute.

- [x] Discover native chat providers from Prompture metadata instead of an eight-entry dropdown, deduplicate aliases, and label missing optional dependencies.
- [x] Provide provider-specific fields, compatible-endpoint presets, and named encrypted connections with a panel default.
- [x] Support OmniRoute and other compatible gateways with exact model IDs, including slashes and routing aliases, plus discovery and manual entry.
- [x] Select a connection/model for new chats; retain it on resume and allow credential rotation without rerouting old chats.
- [x] Test compatible endpoints with a real bounded chat request; verify native model discovery and surface failures rather than treating driver construction as success.
- [x] Migrate existing settings and matching conversations, preserve write confirmations and RBAC, and test secret isolation, streaming, tool protocol, and fresh/resumed conversations.

See [AI provider connections](docs/AI_PROVIDERS.md) for setup and compatibility details. ServerKit uses Prompture 1.11.0's existing drivers, including native streaming and tool calls through its OpenAI-compatible driver. Automatic cross-connection fallback remains a separate feature. OmniRoute-compatible protocol behavior is covered by HTTP transport tests; a live OmniRoute instance is still needed for deployment-specific verification.

## Deploy Console & Live Run Logs

The publish pipeline is becoming ServerKit's signature experience: deploy anything, watch it
happen live, and debug failures entirely from the UI.

- [x] Full-page live deploy console for every install and deploy (templates, Git repos, uploads, redeploys)
- [x] Streaming build output with a step timeline, per-step durations, and live elapsed time
- [x] Failure cards showing the real error tail with plain-language hints and one-click retry
- [x] Unified batched run-log layer (database persistence + WebSocket push, polling fallback)
- [x] Extensions can put their own long-running work on the same console — WordPress environment promotions are the first, with live steps, logs and retry

## Extension Platform

- [x] Runtime frontend loading — installed extensions render without rebuilding the panel
- [x] Extensions plug into the panel's own surfaces — their work shows up in the deploy console, their data in backups and restore, their health on the doctor page, their objects in search, and they can run commands across the fleet
- [x] Explicit install consent for unsigned, unreviewed or third-party extension code
- [x] Signed extension releases — all downloadable first-party artifacts publish detached ed25519 signatures, the canonical and bundled indexes carry them, and registry CI re-downloads and verifies the exact bytes against the pinned publisher key
- [x] The WordPress flagship extracted to its own repo and installed from the Marketplace like any other extension
- [x] Security suite (Fail2ban, ClamAV, Lynis, auto-updates, image scanning) as installable extensions for a leaner default panel — the security omnibus is split, a fresh panel's Security page is a lean zero-host-package baseline, each tool is its own extension repo mounting the same routes and tabs when installed, upgraded panels with the host tool present get the extension back automatically, and the setup wizard asks how much security tooling to install
- [x] The remaining built-ins extracted to standalone repos — localkit, email, cloudflare-ops and git (Gitea half; the deploy pipeline stays core) each have a standalone repo with the proven build/release pipeline; the in-tree copies stay bundled until each repo's first signed release lands in the registry, then the final cutover removes them

## Game Server Hosting (new extension family)

- [x] Minecraft server extension: guided setup, live console, player management, world backups, scheduled restarts with in-game warnings
- [x] Reusable game-server framework (console, players, saves, schedules) enabling future titles
- [x] "Share with friends" connect card
- [ ] Optional domain support for the connect card (SRV records)

## Fleet & Agents

- [ ] Live command-output streaming from remote agents into the deploy console

## Release Engineering

- [ ] End-to-end verification sweep and publishing round for pending releases and extension repos
